# Competitive Programming Solutions

This repository contains a great set of problem solutions from programming websites and online competitions.

The majority of solutions are sorted by its website folder as it may facilitate the search for specific questions. Most of them were written during my studies and practice during the 2020 pandemic. Even so, many of them are from competitions and contests from past years.

As I mainly practice on [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), most of the content in this repository is [here](codeforces/)

## CPPLIB

During your search, you will likely find files with includes similar to the ones below:

```c++
#include <cpplib/stdinc.hpp>
#include <cpplib/adt/matrix.hpp>
#include <cpplib/adt/modular.hpp>
```

They are referring to my **C++ Competitive Programming Personal Library**, which contains several well-known algorithms and data structures implementation that I use to solve programming problems.

This library isn't public yet, but I intend to release it on my ICPC retirement :). Even though its content is widely used in this repository, you should not find any difficulty to understand the solutions as you can find most algorithms on the internet.

## Missing/Incomplete Solutions

Some solutions are missing as I participated in some contests as a team.

In other cases, I may have upsolved only a small set of their problems as I was following some specific problem set.

Also, it's possible, even though rare, to find incomplete solutions :/. That may happen because I usually create a templated file for each problem, but I don't always solve them during the contest. In an even rare case, I may have forgotten to completely upsolve a problem (so the solution may not even compile xd).

It will surely be laborious, but I intend to include the team solution and to remove the incomplete ones (someday :)).

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this repository by sending your solutions to other problems.

## Software Engineering Note

The solutions here were written to solve problems during time-limited competitions. Thus, the only standards taken into account were the ones that could lead me to a better ranking position.

That said, the solutions here are not beautiful in many software standards (or good practice) levels, but they are faster enough to solve exactly what it was meant to solve :).
